Getting Started with Google Earth Engine 
Google Earth Engine is a cloud-computing Platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. It can be used to conduct LULC changes, Map Trends, Perform Analysis at a larger extent and literally do anything dealing with geospatial data and be presented in a meaningful manner.

To get started, you will require to have a google earth engine accont. Therefore it is important to set up your google earth engine account right. 

Steps to follow for registration;

Use your browser and go to the URL “ https://code.earthengine.google.com/ ". If you don’t have already a GEE session opened, the Google signin screen will be displayed. If you choose to use one of your existing Google email accounts, click "Next" If you choose to create a brand new email account, for example specifically for learning GEE and later teach your students, click on "Create account" and choose "For myself"
You'll then follow the usual process to create a Google email account.

2. If you already have a google account, then, give the existing Google email account, type it and click "Next", things will be faster. You'll be instructed to associate the new Earth Engine credentials with your existing email account.

You'll now  be presented a short questionnaire about what you'll do with Google Earth Engine.

NB: If you experience problems creating a google earth engine account, there is a high possibility that you haven't verified your account. It is then recomended that you use  a student email address to your institution.


Google Earth Engine Follow-up Code(Let's Learn Together!):
Once you have signed up and received confirmation of your Google Earth Engine account, you can now click on each code provided here to follow along as we do the Google Earth Engine Processes. Let us learn together!

 By clicking on the following links provided below, you will be redirected you to the Google Earth Engine Code Editor and see the scipts as we learn together. It is basically designed to introduce you to the basic mechanics of working in Google Earth Engine.
